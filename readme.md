### Dentt React FrontEnd

This was a prototype for the FrontEnd of the Dentt App. Im publishing it so that it may be reviewed. Do take its contents with a grain of salt, since they are no longer representative of my expertise as a React developer.

The goal with this prototype was to arrive quickly to a working version of the product so that it could be used by our early adopters. Therefore, no time was invested in centralizing state in a single store (no redux or context API) and no optimizations were made in terms of lazy loading or memoization. Cookies are being used in this case since a limited number of users were testing the application at this point. For the same reasons, security was also not a concern.

Thank you for taking the time to review this code.

Kind regards,
